1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  

   The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is that of headless browsers. I think it's really fun to be able to run code that scrapes HTML from a browser automatically and can run across thousands of queries.

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

   One potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project is in sentiment analysis algorithms, such as Google's Perspective. I'm interested if there is a bias that exists where Perspective API, which is a sentiment analysis model from Google that measures toxicity, ranks certain descriptive terms as more or less toxic than others that should be equal. For example, it would be interesting if the model ranked the sentence "I love going to school in Canada" more positively than "I love going to school in Mozambique." (It does rank the first one as less toxic). What is the model picking up on that makes it think going to school in Mozambique is worse? Does the model think the second sentence is using sarcasm? These are questions I'm interested in investigating for the Quarter 2 Project.

3. **What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

   One change I'd make to the approach in Quarter 1 is to add more data collection, by adding different terms to the search queries. An example could be adding a state name to the search query or a middle initial in the name.

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

   Another technique I would be interested in using is mapmaking. I think the geographical features of both our projects have the potential to lead to some very interesting maps. An example for Quarter 1 could be determining which states have more criminal ads show up when you google a full name and that state, or which states have more of a bias for criminal ads showing up for certain groups. For Quarter 2, an interesting geographical way to display a potential bias could be the example I used in question 2, but that sentence could be modified from going to school to things like "living in ___" or "going sightseeing in ___" or a list of many other things and this sentence could iterate through a list of all countries.
